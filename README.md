# Capsule

Utility scripts to easily "pop out" and install my basic development environment setup on a new machine.

## Name & Inspiration

**Capsule** is inspired by *Dragon Ball*â€™s Capsule Corp, where entire tools, vehicles, or homes pop out of tiny capsules.

This project is the same idea: *A portable setup that instantly pops out my dev environment*.
